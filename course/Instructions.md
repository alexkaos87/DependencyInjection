The code that comes with this course is organized per clip. For most of the clips you find both the 
"before" and the "after." If you want to follow along with the course, open the "before" 
code and just follow along! If at any point you struggle, or are tired of typing, you can
open the "after" code to examine the completed demo.

Sometimes there is no seperate "before" solution. In that case you can continue from the previous solution.

To run any of the demos , use the terminal, `cd` into the proper directory, and run `dotnet build` or `dotnet run`

For example, to run module 3's start code, do the following. This is similar for all other projects:

1. In the terminal, issue the command `cd ~/workspace/00_Before/3.2A\ BeforeSingleton/ProductImporter`
1. Execute `dotnet run` in the first Terminal and wait for the application to run on the console.

Please note: if you are running any of the "before" examples, you might run into a compiler error. When 
this happens, you know where to start working!
